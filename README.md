This plugin gives you the ability to add Amazon Inspector vulnerability scans to your pipeline. These scans produce detailed reports at the end of your build so you can investigate and remediate risk before deployment. These scans can also be configured to pass or fail pipeline executions based on the number and severity of vulnerabilities detected.

Amazon Inspector is a vulnerability management service offered by AWS that scans container images for both operating system and programming language package vulnerabilities based on CVEs.
